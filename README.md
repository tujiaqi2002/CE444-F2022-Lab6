### Pros of Test Driven Development
- While you writing all small tests at a time, this force your code to be more modular and clean. And also TDD helps you to learn, understand, and internalise the key principles of good modular design.
- TDD also help you to maintain a good architecture.
- Code are easir to amintain and refactor
- Help the collaboration more easier and more efficient because you already set up the testable goals and working direction.
- etc.

### Cons of TDD
- More coding and test suite itself has to be maintained, even tests may not be completely determinstic
- The tests may be hard to write, so it's more time-consuming
- Some test don't give programmers any feedback on quality of the unit tests
- Unit testing is somthing the whole team has to buy into, otherwise it's hard to implement inside a time
- etc.
